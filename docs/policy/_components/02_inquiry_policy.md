##Inquiry Handling Policy

* Linux solutions  for RZ MPUs include open-source software (OSS), but not all features of the OSS have been evaluated. 

* In general, Renesas only accepts inquiries for "Renesas developed SW" and "Functions of OSS used for validation of VLP". Renesas cannot answer questions about issues caused by software developed/modified/added by customers.

* Renesas cannot answer questions about issues in environments other than our evaluation boards (e.g., custom boards). Please confirm in advance that the same issue also occurs with our evaluation boards.

* Renesas does not provide analysis services using the customer's operating environment, either on-site or off-site.

* Please see the FAQ in the next section.
