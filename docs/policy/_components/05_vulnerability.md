##Policy for OSS vulnerability 

* OSS vulnerability issues are the responsibility of OSS developers and related communities. Renesas does not directly fix OSS vulnerabilities.

* Renesas RZ Linux Solutions addresses vulnerability issues by updating OSS during periodic maintenance. By adopting the updated OSS, RZ Linux Solutions can indirectly address the vulnerability issues.

* Vulnerability issues that Renesas deems important for security may be updated without waiting for periodic maintenance, but other vulnerability issues must wait for scheduled each solution's updates. If you cannot wait, you are responsible for addressing the vulnerability issue.

* With the above background, Renesas always recommends using the latest version of the RZ Linux Solutions. Please note that the guide to apply patch files included in latest version solutions to previous version solusions is not supported.
